         <p align="center"><b>Creating API Documentation </b> </p>

        <p span style="font-size: small"; align: "center">In creating the documentation for my API library, I utilized GitHub, GithHub Desktop and Visual Studio code. 
                GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories using a GUI (graphic user interface) instead of the command line or a web browser. Ultimately, helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. I stored my codes on their online platform. Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows. This software is useful in building and debugging modern web and cloud applications. I utilized Visual Studio Code on my local computer to create the HTML webpage that showcases the documentation for my class library. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It also allowed me to further customize my website using CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. HTML and CSS files were programmed and modified within the Visual Studio Code software and pushed to my GitHub repository using GitHub Desktop.
